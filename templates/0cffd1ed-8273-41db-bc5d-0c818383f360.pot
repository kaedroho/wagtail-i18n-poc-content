"Despite its name, it is in fact a cake, and not a pie.[2] The dessert acquired its name when cakes and pies were cooked in the same pans, and the words were used interchangeably.[3] In the latter "
"part of the 19th century, this type of cake was variously called a &quot;cream pie&quot;, a &quot;chocolate cream pie&quot;, or a &quot;custard cake&quot;.[3]"

"Owners of the Parker House Hotel in Boston claim that the Boston cream pie was first created at the hotel by Armenian-French chef M. Sanzian in 1856.[4] Called a &quot;Chocolate Cream Pie&quot;, "
"this cake consisted of two layers of French butter sponge cake filled with crème pâtissière and brushed with a rum syrup, its side coated with crème pâtissière overlain with toasted sliced almonds, "
"and the top coated with chocolate fondant.[5] However, historians dispute this claim to primacy; while this cake may have been served then, there is no specific contemporaneous evidence of it, and "
"custard-filled cake was already popular at that time.[3]"

"The cake is likely derived from the Washington pie, a two-layer yellow cake filled with jam and topped with confectioner&#39;s sugar, for which pastry cream of custard eventually replaced the jam, "
"and a chocolate glaze replaced the confectioner&#39;s sugar.[2] Today, the cake is topped with a chocolate glaze (such as ganache) and sometimes powdered sugar or a cherry."
