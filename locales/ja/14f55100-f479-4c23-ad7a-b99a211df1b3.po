"Yeasts, with their single-celled growth habit, can be contrasted with molds, which grow hyphae. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on temperature or other conditions) are called "
"dimorphic fungi (&quot;dimorphic&quot; means &quot;having two forms&quot;)."

"Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom. The yeast lineage[which?] originated hundreds of millions of years ago, and 1,500 species are "
"currently identified.[1][2][3] They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal species.[4] Yeasts are unicellular organisms which evolved from multicellular ancestors,[5] with some "
"species having the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae.[6] Yeast sizes vary greatly, depending on "
"species and environment, typically measuring 3–4 µm in diameter, although some yeasts can grow to 40 µm in size.[7] Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by the asymmetric "
"division process known as budding."

"By fermentation, the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae converts carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols – for thousands of years the carbon dioxide has been used in baking and the alcohol "
"in alcoholic beverages.[8] It is also a centrally important model organism in modern cell biology research, and is one of the most thoroughly researched eukaryotic microorganisms. Researchers have "
"used it to gather information about the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology.[9] Other species of yeasts, such as Candida albicans, are opportunistic pathogens and can cause "
"infections in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in microbial fuel cells,[10] and produce ethanol for the biofuel industry."

"Yeasts do not form a single taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping. The term &quot;yeast&quot; is often taken as a synonym for Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[11] but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is "
"shown by their placement in two separate phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. The budding yeasts (&quot;true yeasts&quot;) are classified in the order Saccharomycetales,[12] within the "
"phylum Ascomycota."
