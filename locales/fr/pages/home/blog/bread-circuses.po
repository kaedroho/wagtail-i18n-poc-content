"baked."

"Heat is <b>gradually</b> transferred \"from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their centre. As heat travels through it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods with a firm dry crust"
" and a softer centre\".[2] Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other. Baking is related to barbecuing "
"because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit."

"Because of historical social and familial roles, <a id=\"a1\">baking</a> has traditionally been performed at home by women for domestic consumption and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local "
"consumption. When production was industrialized, baking was automated by machines in large factories. The art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition, as baked goods, "
"especially breads, are a common but important food, both from an economic and cultural point of view. A person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker."
